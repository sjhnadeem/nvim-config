# My Personal Nvim Config

![Alt text](screenshot.png?raw=true "NeoVim screenshot")

## Setup

### Linux

- Go to `/.config` directory
- clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/sjhnadeem/nvim-config`
- it will create `nvim-config` directory inside the `/.config` directory
- Rename the directory to `nvim` so command would be `mv nvim-config nvim`
- Now open terminal and run the nvim or vim command
- It might show some warning messages though, so you have to install some plugins using below command in normal mode

```
:PlugInstall
```

- Wait for some time to install them (those plugins will be installed in `~/.vim` directory )
- Now restart your nvim or vim program

### Windows

- Open Power Shell or command prompt
- Change directory to `~/AppData/Local`
- clone this repo in that directory
- it will create `nvim-config` directory inside it
- Now rename that directory to `nvim` and you are done
- Now run the `nvim` command to open neo vim
- It might show some warning messages though, so you have to install some plugins using below command in normal mode

```
:PlugInstall
```

- Wait for some time to install them (those plugins will be installed in `~/.vim` directory )
- Now restart your nvim or vim program
